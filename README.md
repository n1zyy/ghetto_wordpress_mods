# My Ghetto WordPress Mods

Warning:

* You probably shouldn't use these.
* These are probably bad code.

These are some things I've hacked together to suit my needs,
where existing plugins were too heavy or just didn't do the job.

The "CDN rewriter" one is especially interesting to me, because
all I wanted to do was have static assets on a site go through
CloudFront, but for some reason it seemed like my only choice was
a few giant plugins, most of which didn't even do quite what I
wanted. So I wrote the simplest possible solution.

If these are useful, feel free to use them... At your own risk.
